    Evidence becomes both a tool in our hand and a rod for our back. It is how we learn about the true performance of our organisation, so we can manage it and also manage how we are judged for that performance. We cannot have the former without the latter.

    So the price for informed decision making is transparency and accountability. And that's a price that appears too high for many leaders. They keep their heads in the sand and steer by gut feel; they distract with hearsay and anecdote and biased selection of data. But what these leaders don't realise is that the price of transparency and accountability is much lower than the price of ignorance.

    Decision is about helping people take ownership of the results that matter by role-modelling ownership, getting their buy-in and giving them a clear line of sight to the corporate strategy. Action is about helping people get the right things done to achieve the results that matter, through a focus on causal analysis, practicality and collaboration.

    Mindsets for Direction
For the leadership habit of Direction, the following three mindsets help us articulate a well-designed strategy that is results-oriented, understandable to everyone and ruthlessly prioritised:

Results, not actions. Write strategic goals that are results-oriented, not action-oriented (action comes later).
No weasel words. Clearly articulate the strategic goals in language everyone will understand (they can't buy into what they don't understand).
Be ruthless. Ruthlessly prioritise the strategic goals to focus on performance results that matter most, right now (the more goals you have, the fewer you'll achieve

Leverage, not force. Implement or execute strategy based on working smarter, not harder.
Patterns, not points. Make strategy execution about removing and managing variability, not about hitting the numbers.
Processes, not people. Execute strategy to improve business processes and how work is designed, not to control people and what work is done.

Causes, not symptoms. Find ways to remove the constraints that limit capability rather than compensating for lack of capability.
Practical, not perfect. Build the momentum of performance improvement by progressing when it's 80 per cent perfect, rather than waiting for 100 per cent.
Collaboration, not competition. Find and fix the problems that exist in the white space on the organisational chart: the handover points between business units, functions and teams

No failure, only feedback. Celebrate learning — whether it comes from success or failure.
Iterate, don't procrastinate. Set shorter time frames and smaller goals to build the muscle of high performance.

But if we have four to 10 goals, in addition to our whirlwind, we'll achieve only one or two of them.

    Our research lends support to what is sometimes called the “inverse Conway maneuver,” which states that organizations should evolve their team and organizational structure to achieve the desired architecture.

    A stream-aligned team aims to produce a steady flow of feature delivery.
A stream-aligned team is quick to course correct based on feedback from the latest changes.
A stream-aligned team uses an experimental approach to product evolution, expecting to constantly learn and adapt.
A stream-aligned team has minimal (ideally zero) hand-offs of work to other teams.
A stream-aligned team is evaluated on the sustainable flow of change it produces (together with some supporting technical and team-health metrics).
A stream-aligned team must have time and space to address code quality changes (sometimes called “tech debt”) to ensure that changing the code remains safe and easy to do.
A stream-aligned team proactively and regularly reaches out to the supporting fundamental-topologies teams (complicated subsystem, enabling, and platform).
Members of a stream-aligned team feel they have achieved or are in the path to achieving “autonomy, mastery, and purpose,” the three key components of engaged knowledge workers, according to Daniel Pink.7

    When we have a performance gap to close, we're better off looking for leverage: creating a fundamental performance improvement, rather than working harder to keep holding performance up.

    But more often than not, adding more staff is just compensating for a process that isn't capable enough. And compensating for performance is not leverage. 
As Albert Einstein said, we can't solve a problem with the same level of thinking that created the problem. We need a level of thinking that helps us find the root causes that are choking our processes so they can't perform any better.

    The measure will show us that there is an unacceptable gap between as-is performance and to-be performance, and our improvement project should close as much of that gap as possible. The measure needs to be the lens through which we search for causes that constrain performance.

    James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones, in their book Lean Thinking, define waste this way:
… specifically any human activity which absorbs resources but creates no value: mistakes which require rectification, production of items no one wants so that inventories and remaindered goods pile up, processing steps which aren't actually needed, movement of employees and transport of goods from one place to another without any purpose, groups of people in downstream activity standing around waiting because an upstream activity has not delivered on time, and goods and services which don't meet the needs of the customer.

    Organisations are wholes. Unlike machines, if they are pulled apart and put back together again, they won't be the same. They may not even survive the ordeal. Organisations are organisms: unlike machines, they are self-organising and adaptive. They can adapt, and even change, their environment
